# About

This is a repository holding the JupyterNotebooks and any relevant notes I take down as I work with Pyroomacoustics in a speech-enhancement beamforming project.

I plan to start by looking through [this website](https://pyroomacoustics.readthedocs.io/en/pypi-release/index.html), and replicating the code to understand all of it.
